# Vue JS Setup
 A standard vue JS setup with vuex and vue-router
 
Vuex is a persistent data store that is seperated from the component tree, allowing you to share data between objects within the tree without the use of props and/or events.

Vue-router offers the ability to have routes and middleware within the SPA itself.

# Setting it up

$: composer install

$: npm install

$: npm run watch

$: valet link

Then go to PROJECT_NAME.test in the browser.
